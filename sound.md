Let’s provide a comprehensive roundup of the voltages, dBu values, and other relevant levels for your entire signal chain (DAC → Studer 903 HL with EQ → External Fader → Studer Dual Limiter → Studer Line Amplifiers → Genelec 1086A/1083A) with the Studer line amplifiers set to unity gain (0 dB). This will give you a clear picture of the signal levels at each stage, the expected SPL at the Genelec speakers, and how your -8 LUFS track will perform through this setup. I’ll also include any necessary adjustments to achieve your target SPL for monitoring.

---

### Step 1: Signal Chain Overview and Assumptions
- **Signal Chain:** DAC → Studer 903 HL with EQ → External Fader → Studer Dual Limiter → Studer Line Amplifiers (at unity gain) → Genelec 1086A/1083A.
- **Test Signal:** 0 dBFS, 1 kHz sine wave (unless otherwise noted, for peak levels).
- **Track:** -8 LUFS, with peaks at 0 dBFS and RMS at -10 dBFS (based on typical loudness standards for a -8 LUFS mix).
- **Line Amplifiers:** Set to unity gain (0 dB), meaning the output level equals the input level, with possible minor insertion loss from the transformers (assumed 0.5 dB for calculation purposes, typical for high-quality transformers).
- **Target SPL:** Aiming for 95 dB SPL peaks (85 dB SPL RMS) at 1 meter for long-term listening, or 100 dB SPL peaks (90 dB SPL RMS) for critical evaluation. We’ll calculate both options.

### Step 2: Signal Levels at Each Stage
#### 1. DAC Output
- **DAC Trim Setting:** +15 dBu at 0 dBFS (as previously established).
- **Voltage:** \( 0.775 \cdot 10^{(15/20)} \approx 4.36 \, \text{V RMS} \).
- **Level:** +15 dBu (4.36 V RMS) at 0 dBFS.
- **Track Levels:**
  - Peaks: +15 dBu (0 dBFS).
  - RMS: +5 dBu (-10 dBFS, since -8 LUFS typically has peaks at 0 dBFS and RMS 10 dB below).

#### 2. Studer 903 HL with EQ (Line Input to PF Insert)
- **Input:** +15 dBu (4.36 V RMS) at 0 dBFS.
- **GAIN Pot:** 0 dB (centered, as previously confirmed).
- **PF Insert (Unloaded, Measured):**
  - Left: 2.122 V RMS = +8.74 dBu.
  - Right: 2.124 V RMS = +8.76 dBu.
  - Average: +8.75 dBu (2.123 V RMS).
- **Drop from Input:** 15 dBu - 8.75 dBu = 6.25 dB (consistent with the Studer 903’s internal gain structure and GAIN pot setting).
- **Track Levels at PF Insert:**
  - Peaks: +8.75 dBu (0 dBFS).
  - RMS: -1.25 dBu (-10 dBFS).

#### 3. External Fader (After PF Insert)
- **Input (PF Insert):** +8.75 dBu (2.123 V RMS) at 0 dBFS.
- **Fader Gain (Loaded):** -2.84 dB (adjusted to compensate for the 4.22 dB loading drop caused by the Dual Limiter’s input impedance).
- **Fader Output (Unloaded, Calculated):**
  - +8.75 dBu - 2.84 dB = +5.91 dBu (1.97 V RMS).
- **Fader Output (Loaded, Measured):**
  - 1.03 V RMS = +2.46 dBu (with Dual Limiter connected, after adjusting for the 4.22 dB loading drop).
  - Loading Drop: 5.91 dBu - 2.46 dBu = 3.45 dB (slightly less than the previously measured 4.22 dB drop, possibly due to measurement variation or a change in the limiter’s input impedance under different conditions).
- **Track Levels at Fader Output (Loaded):**
  - Peaks: +2.46 dBu (0 dBFS).
  - RMS: -7.54 dBu (-10 dBFS).

#### 4. Studer Dual Limiter
- **Input (Fader Output, Loaded):** +2.46 dBu (1.03 V RMS).
- **Limiter Threshold:** +3 dBu (1.095 V RMS).
- **Limiter Output (Unloaded, Measured):** 1.03 V RMS = +2.46 dBu (matches the input, indicating no gain reduction since the input is below the threshold).
- **Limiter Output (Loaded, Estimated):**
  - The Genelec 1086A/1083A speakers have a high input impedance (typically 10 kΩ), and the Studer line amplifiers (next in the chain) also have a high input impedance (likely >10 kΩ due to the transformer). The Dual Limiter’s output impedance is low (<100 ohms), so the loading drop should be minimal (<0.1 dB).
  - Expected: ~+2.46 dBu (1.03 V RMS).
- **Track Levels at Limiter Output:**
  - Peaks: +2.46 dBu (0 dBFS).
  - RMS: -7.54 dBu (-10 dBFS).

#### 5. Studer Line Amplifiers (at Unity Gain)
- **Input (Limiter Output):** +2.46 dBu (1.03 V RMS).
- **Gain Setting:** 0 dB (unity).
- **Insertion Loss (Assumed):** 0.5 dB (typical for a high-quality transformer, due to magnetic coupling inefficiencies).
- **Line Amplifier Output (Unloaded):**
  - +2.46 dBu - 0.5 dB = +1.96 dBu (0.975 V RMS).
- **Line Amplifier Output (Loaded, Estimated):**
  - The Genelec 1086A/1083A speakers have a high input impedance (10 kΩ), and the line amplifier’s transformer output impedance is likely low (<100 ohms). The loading drop should be negligible (<0.1 dB).
  - Expected: ~+1.96 dBu (0.975 V RMS).
- **Track Levels at Line Amplifier Output:**
  - Peaks: +1.96 dBu (0 dBFS).
  - RMS: -8.04 dBu (-10 dBFS).

#### 6. Genelec 1086A/1083A Speakers
- **Input (Line Amplifier Output):** +1.96 dBu (0.975 V RMS).
- **Input Sensitivity (Assumed, Based on 1032A):** +6 dBu = 100 dB SPL at 1 meter.
- **SPL Calculation:**
  - Input: +1.96 dBu (3.54 dB below +6 dBu).
  - SPL: 100 dB SPL - 4.04 dB = 95.96 dB SPL peaks at 1 meter.
- **Track SPL at Genelecs:**
  - Peaks: 95.96 dB SPL (0 dBFS).
  - RMS: 85.96 dB SPL (-10 dBFS).
- **Target SPL:**
  - **Option 1: 95 dB SPL Peaks (85 dB SPL RMS):** The current level (95.96 dB SPL peaks) is very close, only 0.96 dB above the target. This is effectively on target for long-term listening, as 85.96 dB SPL RMS aligns with standard mixing levels (83–85 dB SPL RMS).
  - **Option 2: 100 dB SPL Peaks (90 dB SPL RMS):** Requires an additional 4.04 dB gain (100 dB SPL - 95.96 dB SPL).

#### Adjust Gain to Hit Target SPL
- **Option 1: 95 dB SPL Peaks (85 dB SPL RMS):**
  - Current: 95.96 dB SPL peaks.
  - Target: 95 dB SPL peaks.
  - Adjustment: Reduce gain by 0.96 dB.
  - **Where to Adjust:**
    - **Genelec Sensitivity:** If the 1086A/1083A have sensitivity controls (like the 1032A), reduce the sensitivity by 0.96 dB (e.g., set to -0.96 dB).
    - **Line Amplifier:** Reduce the line amplifier gain to -0.96 dB (slight attenuation).
    - **Post-Line Amplifier:** Apply a -0.96 dB attenuation (e.g., via a monitor controller before the Genelecs).
  - **New Genelec Input:** +1.96 dBu - 0.96 dB = +1 dBu (0.87 V RMS).
  - **New SPL:** 95 dB SPL peaks, 85 dB SPL RMS (ideal for long-term listening).
- **Option 2: 100 dB SPL Peaks (90 dB SPL RMS):**
  - Current: 95.96 dB SPL peaks.
  - Target: 100 dB SPL peaks.
  - Adjustment: Increase gain by 4.04 dB.
  - **Where to Adjust:**
    - **Genelec Sensitivity:** Increase the sensitivity by 4.04 dB (e.g., set to +4.04 dB).
    - **Line Amplifier:** Increase the line amplifier gain to +4.04 dB.
    - **Post-Line Amplifier:** Apply a 4.04 dB boost (e.g., via a monitor controller).
  - **New Genelec Input:** +1.96 dBu + 4.04 dB = +6 dBu (1.55 V RMS).
  - **New SPL:** 100 dB SPL peaks, 90 dB SPL RMS (suitable for critical evaluation, though RMS is slightly loud).

### Step 3: Roundup of Voltages and Values
Here’s a table summarizing the voltages, dBu levels, and SPL for the entire signal chain at 0 dBFS (peaks) and for the -8 LUFS track (RMS), with the line amplifiers at unity gain and adjustments for both SPL targets:

| **Stage**                  | **Peaks (0 dBFS)** | **RMS (-10 dBFS)** | **Notes**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Genelec SPL (Option 1)** | 95 dB SPL peaks | 85 dB SPL RMS | Ideal for long-term listening, aligns with standard mixing levels.      |
| **Genelec Input (Option 2: 100 dB SPL Peaks)** | +6 dBu (1.55 V RMS) | -4 dBu (0.49 V RMS) | +4.04 dB boost to hit 100 dB SPL peaks.                                |
| **Genelec SPL (Option 2)** | 100 dB SPL peaks | 90 dB SPL RMS | Suitable for critical evaluation, RMS slightly loud.                    |

### Step 4: Recommendations for Monitoring
- **Preferred SPL Target:** Option 1 (95 dB SPL peaks, 85 dB SPL RMS) is recommended for long-term listening, as it aligns with standard mixing levels (83–85 dB SPL RMS) and reduces the risk of ear fatigue, especially given the Genelec 1032A’s (and likely 1086A/1083A’s) slightly hyped high end.
- **Adjustment:** With the line amplifiers at unity gain, the Genelec input is +1.96 dBu, producing 95.96 dB SPL peaks. Reduce the gain by 0.96 dB (e.g., via Genelec sensitivity controls, line amplifier attenuation, or a monitor controller) to hit 95 dB SPL peaks exactly.
- **Alternative (Critical Listening):** If you need to evaluate the track at a louder level, use Option 2 (100 dB SPL peaks) by applying a 4.04 dB boost, but monitor at this level sparingly to avoid fatigue.

#### Tonal Considerations
- The Studer line amplifiers at unity gain introduce minimal transformer coloration (at +1.96 dBu, the transformer is unlikely to saturate significantly). The Genelec 1086A/1083A will provide an accurate representation of your -8 LUFS track, with the 1086A’s 2x12" woofers and three-way design offering extended low-end response (down to ~30 Hz) and improved midrange clarity.
- If you want more warmth, increase the line amplifier gain (e.g., to 6 dB) to drive the transformer harder, then attenuate post-line amplifier to maintain the target SPL.

#### Room and Speaker Setup
- **Listening Distance:** The 1086A, with its larger drivers, is likely suited for midfield monitoring (2–3 meters), while the 1083A may be better for nearfield (1–2 meters). Position them accordingly and angle them toward your listening position for optimal stereo imaging.
- **Room Correction:** If the Genelecs have room correction controls (like the 1032A’s bass/treble tilt and roll-off switches), adjust them to compensate for room acoustics (e.g., reduce bass if placed near walls).

---

### Step 5: Next Steps
- **Adjust Gain:** Apply the -0.96 dB adjustment (for 95 dB SPL peaks) or +4.04 dB boost (for 100 dB SPL peaks) and confirm the SPL at 1 meter with a 0 dBFS test tone.
- **Test the Track:** Play the -8 LUFS track and listen for clarity, balance, and dynamics. Use the 1086A for primary monitoring and the 1083A as a secondary reference.
- **Share Observations:** Report on tonal balance, dynamics, goniometer behavior, and any ear fatigue.
- **Confirm Setup:** Share the listening distance and room setup for the 1086A/1083A to ensure optimal performance.
